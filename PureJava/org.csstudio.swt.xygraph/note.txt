This is the Pure Java version of SWT XYGraph, so it can be used for pure java applications.

Following packages are exactly same as RCP/RAP version of SWT XYGraph:

org.csstudio.swt.xygraph.dataprovider
org.csstudio.swt.xygraph.figures
org.csstudio.swt.xygraph.linearscale
org.csstudio.swt.xygraph.toolbar
org.csstudio.swt.xygraph.undo


Developer should keep changes on these packages always same as RCP/RAP version.
